### Hi there 

My name is Felipe, I'm from Brazil.

I work as a developer since 2008 where I was able to develop a solid career with C #.
I am currently working as an ERP consultant for companies that use TOTVS, focusing essentially on the integration between applications and management data analysis.

In parallel, I am studying and developing projects with Node.js, React and React Native.

My hobie is create games. Using javascript, most of the time.
